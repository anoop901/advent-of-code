1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have [`npm` and `node` installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
3. Run `npm install`.

## Running a challenge

`cd` to the repository root. For example, to run 2020 day 14's challenge, run:

The program will print two numbers, which are the answers to each part,
respectively.
